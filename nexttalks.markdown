Algebraic Geometry seminar

Title: Feynman periods and Eichler integrals of modular forms

Abstract: Quantum prediction of particle interactions is related to algebraic geometry and to number theory (more precisely, to motives and to their periods). In this talk I will introduce one of the most recent instances of this fruitful interdisciplinary relationship. More precisely, I will give an introduction to the classical theory of Eichler integrals and period polynomials of modular forms, and explain how new ideas introduced by Y. Manin and F. Brown are connected to new period integrals encountered in quantum field theory and string theory. I do not assume any previous knowledge in physics, and I will briefly recall the definition and main properties of modular forms.
