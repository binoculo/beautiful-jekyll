## Why Z, Y and X always fail at having a threesome

**ABSTRACT:** The variables X, Y and Z are frenzied little suckers. They'd be sucking faces all day long when you're not watching, if aren't careful, but whenever they try at a threesome, they fail miserably. Why? The Equal Sign AKA Evil Overlord AKA "=" (for your slow, non-mathemagician minds), is always one step ahead, dividing the aspiring lovers without mercy.

$$ x=\frac{1+y}{1+2z^2} $$

## On proving that not all chalks are created equals

**ABSTRACT:** Whenever I use a chalk on my blackboard I am able to precisely determine whether the chalk will either break or squeak. By sucking an end (the one you won't be using, preferably) you can sample the granulosity and quality of the chalk. I suggest you try that, too.
As proven by:

$$ f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi $$

## Losing strings: elliptic multiple zeta values

**ABSTRACT:** Think about strings. Yes, your shoes' strings. Einstein was really talking about them, on his ramblings. He was trying to find the most efficient way to tie your shoes, because he was always stumbling down while working at the patent office. I set out to prove that the elliptic multiple zeta values are coordinates for where your hands and strings need to be while tying your shoes.

 \! \langle \mathbf{z},\mathbf{y}\rangle 
 \,d\mathbf{z}
