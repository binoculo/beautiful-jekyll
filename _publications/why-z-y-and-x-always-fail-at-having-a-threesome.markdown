ABSTRACT: The variables X, Y and Z are frenzied little suckers. They'd be sucking faces and worse places all day long, if you're not watching, but whenever they try a threesome, they fail miserably. Why? The Equal Sign AKA Evil Overlord AKA "=" (for your slow, non-mathemagician minds), is always one step ahead, dividing the aspiring lovers without mercy.

$$ x=\frac{1+y}{1+2z^2} $$
