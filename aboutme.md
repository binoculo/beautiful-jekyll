My name is Federico Zerbini. I am a mathemagician.

Also:

- I party all day long with numbers
- I dream all night long of you-clid (as in Euclid)

What else do you need to know?

### my history

It's long and epic, like my favourite book: "La Pimpa va in citt√†".

Only less polka-dot-y.

La-di-da.

Oh yeah.
