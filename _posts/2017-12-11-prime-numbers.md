When I was a kid I started counting while playing hide and seek.

When I got to 9 I got really angry, because it was not a prime number.

After 1, 3, 5 and 7, I convinced myself that all odd numbers would also be prime numbers, but when 9 came up, I got very very angry.

So angry, that if a pidgeon had passed near me, I would probably have kicked it.

And killed it.

I'm dangerous.

So I got on to 10, then 11, and everything was ok again.

The problem is that now I can't stop counting.

I have been counting prime numbers since then. I have a privileged mind, so I can do two things at a time (sometimes three), so I was able to get on with my life; finish school; kiss girls; play music; try a "special" brownie; get all whiny (but in a very manly way); and all the while I was still counting prime numbers.

The last one I found is 2<sup>74,207,281</sup> -1.

It's getting tricky now.

But I'm not giving up.
